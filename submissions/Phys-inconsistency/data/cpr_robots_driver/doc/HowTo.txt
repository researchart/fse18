How to set up the ROS stack cpr_robots_driver
---------------------------------------------

1. Download from gitHub:
https://github.com/CPR-Robots/cpr_robots_driver

2. Connect the USB2CAN bridge to your USB port

3. Start the teleoperation scenario:
First get into the directory:	roscd cpr_robots_teleop
Then start the launch file:	roslaunch teleop.launch

4. Drive the robot with the keys w/s, a/s and e/q

When ist does not work:
* Recompile with make clean and make? Are all necessary dependencies available?
* Is the boost library installed?
* When there is no connection to the USB2CAN bridge:
	- the preset for the port is /dev/ttyUSB0
	- check with "dmesg | grep USB" if the bridge is connected there
	- change this port in cpr_comm_rs232.cpp if your bridge connected to another port
	- do you have the permission to open ttyUSB0? Try changing permissions: "sudo chmod 0777 /dev/ttyUSB0"
